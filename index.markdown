## Hi, I'm Marie Clemessy _(she/her)_

I am a **software developer** building maintainable and delightful **Android** consumer applications since **2018.**

I was most recently building [Outlook for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.office.outlook&hl=en_US&gl=US) at **Microsoft**. Before that, I spent **three** years on the _backend_ teams of Outlook Mobile and [Sunrise Calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrise_Calendar).

At the moment, I am taking a **sabbatical**, and I spend some of my time building Android projects using Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, and other modern Android APIs.

## I am also
- a [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) alumn (2014) and [HEC Paris](https://www.hec.edu/en) graduate (2013),
- a freelance **technical interviewer** and a podcast host,
- a **tea** person, an international **catsitter**, and an occasional **sewist**.

## I am open to work!
I am available for contract, freelance, or full-time Android positions in the US or the EU, remote or in-person. Don't hesitate to contact me at [hi@mariecl.dev](mailto:hi@mariecl.dev) if you are interested in hiring me or find out more about me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marieclemessy/).
